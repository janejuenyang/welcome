# Finding a job

Job searching is challenging. It's not uncommon for it to take 6+ months to find the right opportunity that both matches what you are looking to do and provides you with adequate compensation and benefits. Here are some resources I've found to be helpful in the process.

## Priorities

Start off by defining what you are looking for in your next role. It might be helpful to create a document with the following structure to guide your job search:

| Characteristic | Ideal | Bare Minimum | Heck No |
|-|-|-|-|
| Role/responsibilities | _what would be the perfect next opportunity for you?_ | _what would be 'good enough' for your next role?_ | _describe any dealbreakers_ |
| Base salary | | | |
| Other compensation + benefits | | | |
| Location | | | |
| Workload | | | |
| Manager | | | |
| Colleagues | | | |
| Professional development | | | |
| Risk/stability | | | |
| [_other factors that matter to you..._] | | | |

When reviewing job descriptions, evaluate them across the criteria you define for yourself. If a job at least meets the bare minimum, apply. If at any point you learn about a "heck no" dealbreaker, focus on other opportunities instead. Keep an eye out for your ideal next role but don't let finding it block you from pursuing other possibilities.

## Job Boards & Email Lists

While generic job aggregators like Indeed and LinkedIn have lots of listings, there are many more specialized job boards that are worth reviewing. Many allow you to set up custom alerts so that you get emails with jobs that fit your filter criteria are added.
