# Always contextualize your graphs

- Link to relevant background documents and PRs in published research and dashboards
- Outline any assumptions
- Explain what the graphs are meant to show
- Properly label axes unless it is already obvious what they represent from the title of the graph
- Include captions on graphs that describe the chart so that folks who aren't able to see can still understand the main takeaway

# Sweat the details

- Sort graphs by a meaningful dimension
- Preference color-blind accessible color palettes
- Specify decimal accuracy
- Use comma separators for large numbers

# Limit visual distractions

- Use clean backgrounds
- Use clearly-labeled legends when appropriate
- In interactive dashboards, make sure folks can't accidentally mis-aggregate by disabling drill-downs when not applicable
