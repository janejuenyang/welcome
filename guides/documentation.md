# An Ode to Documentation
*or: how to quickly soak up context, be nice to future you, and leave things in a better place*

## What is "documentation"?

To me, documentation is the umbrella term for:

1. Personal notes
2. Shared notes and other project artifacts
3. Final project deliverables
4. References for people (including future you!) who will be using and/or building off of the work you've done

## Why I prioritize documenting

In my experience, the better you are at documentation, the better you are at work overall. Throughout my career, I've noticed that standout colleagues all share a common differentiating skill: knowing *when* and *how* to write things down for posterity. Documentation is the process of turning *implicit* knowledge that's locked up in specific peoples' heads into *explicit* knowledge that can be widely shared. 

When knowledge is explicit:

* It's easier for people to know how and why things work
* People have the information they need to keep things moving, even if someone's on vacation
* Staff turnover doesn't mean losing years of context

## Tactical suggestions

In no particular order, here's how I approach documentation:

* **Write for past and future me:**
  * Make documentation that I would have loved to have gotten when I first joined a team, or that I know I will need if I have to revisit a project years down the road
  * Use [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/)
  * Provide enough context to understand the why/what/when/who/how
  * Put the documentation where it makes most sense for the audience and function. For instance, I give "whys" behind analysis methodologies directly in code comments. I put process guides in shared files or Intranets accessible by people involved in the process.
  * Include enough information to carry on the work without overwhelming with unnecessary historical detail. Before starting to write, I set a target document length (e.g. 1 page, 5 pages, 10 pages) and strive to stick within that target.
  
* **Make cheat sheets:**
  * When learning about a new programmatic or operational area, take notes including objectives, semantics / jargon, acronyms, and links to more context (e.g. websites, research, standards)
  * Upon encountering an opaque process, write down each step you take and then talk to the people in charge of the process to check if what you've written down is "right"
  * Keep track of new people you meet, how to pronounce their names, what they work on, etc. in a private document

* **Share as widely as appropriate:**
  * Turn your cheat sheets into official resources after getting review and approval
  * Share published resources in every relevant channel: Intranets, shared files, public websites, communities of practices, newsletters, standing meetings, email signatures, etc.
  * If sharing a cheat sheet that isn't official, mark it appropriately, e.g. "UNOFFICIAL - last updated MM/DD/YY"

* **Document as I go:**
  * Always take notes
  * Take advantage of opportunities to collectively create notes, e.g. through shared white-boarding
  * Leave TODO/notes-to-self on graphics, details, etc. to add later on
  * If writing/typing speed isn't fast enough to keep up, ask to record the meeting or use a transcription application
  * Set aside wrap-up time at the end of each day to catch up on notes and other records that can be used to make formal documentation later
  
* **Have a system**
  * Be tools-agnostic; your system should adapt to any suite of software, whether Microsoft, Google, or indie.
  * Use tables of contents, header formatting, lists, and tables to organize information.
  * Include purpose, date, attendees, discussion and decision notes, and follow-ups in meeting notes. If you're using a tool without global search, take running notes in the same document to make it easier to search for things later one.
  * Cross-link everywhere! Add links to relevant past notes, documents, websites, etc.
  * Keep the Desktop and Downloads folder clear. Move things out of the Desktop at the end of the day. Tidy up the Downloads folder at least weekly.
  * Have an organized file directory that fits how your brain thinks. Use shortcuts strategically. For instance, I often have shared folders by project, including a running notes document that's shared across the project team. I also have a personal "Running Notes" folder with shortcuts to each of the running notes docs.
